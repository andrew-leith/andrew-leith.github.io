Brown's software page recommends a piece of software that I have a lot of personal experience with, Cyberduck: <br>

Running Cyberduck will open an empty window:

<br><br>

From there, you'll want to click on the 'Open Connection' button in the top left, yielding this window:

<br><br>

Next, you will need to change the connection type from FTP to SFTP in order to be compatible with Oscar:

<br><br>

Next, type in the address of the server, 'ssh.ccv.brown.edu'.  Do not prepend your user ID in this case (like you would from the command line) as the Cyberduck client has a separate field for that:

<br><br>

Then type in your Oscar ID and password.

Once you're connected, you can then drag files to and from the window and they'll be uploaded/downloaded automatically.
