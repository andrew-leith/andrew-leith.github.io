<p align="left">Running Cyberduck will open an empty window:</p>

<p align="left">From there, you'll want to click on the 'Open Connection' button in the top left, yielding this window:</p>

<p align="left">Next, you will need to change the connection type from FTP to SFTP in order to be compatible with Oscar:</p>

<br><br>

<p align="left">Next, type in the address of the server, 'ssh.ccv.brown.edu'.  Do not prepend your user ID in this case (like you would from the command line) as the Cyberduck client has a separate field for that:</p>

<p align="left">Then type in your Oscar ID and password:</p>
